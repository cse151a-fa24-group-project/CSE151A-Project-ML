## Introduction
Our model aims to recognize whether Peter Griffin is on screen during any given moment of a Family Guy episode. In order to train and test our model, we will be scraping frames of Family Guy episodes and manually classifying them by the presence or absence of Peter Griffin. If time permits, we may be able to expand our model to also identify other characters of the show or foray into other television shows or media. We hope that our concept will allow those affected by prosopagnosia to more easily enjoy television shows, especially when applied to live-action formats. Our model may also prove useful in helping people create compilations featuring a character of their choosing.
